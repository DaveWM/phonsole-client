  "body": "[Go to Phonsole App](https://www.phonsole.co.uk)\r\n\r\nPhonsole is a combination of a command line tool and a website, which allows you to quickly and easily view console output from one device on another. \r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n* Use your phone or tablet as a second monitor for output gulp/grunt tasks\r\n* Quickly send a piece of text to your phone - e.g. a readme\r\n* Monitor the output of a command running on a server\r\n\r\n## How?\r\n* Go to https://www.phonsole.co.uk on your phone/tablet, and log in\r\n* Make sure you have nodejs installed on your PC (see [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) for help)\r\n* Run `npm install -g phonsole`\r\n* Pipe the command you want to run into phonsole, e.g. `echo hello | phonsole`\r\n* Log in (using the same account as for the website)\r\n* You should now see the console output on the website\r\n\r\n## Tech\r\nPhonsole is split into 3 parts: client, server, and CLI:\r\n\r\n* *Client* - a single page [progressive web app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/), written in clojurescript.\r\n* *Server* - written in clojure, using ring.\r\n* *CLI* - written in clojurescript, and compiled into a nodejs app. \r\n\r\n[Sente](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente) is used by all 3 components to send and receive messages via websockets.\r\n\r\n## Privacy\r\nPhonsole does not record any data _whatsoever_. Output sent from the CLI is sent to the client, then immediately discarded.\r\n\r\n[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is used to handle authentication, and requests the absolute bare minimum amount of personal information. This information is used purely to display your name and gravatar on the website. Auth0 does record your details, but this information *will not* be used for marketing purposes, or sold to third parties.\r\n\r\n## Running on your own hardware\r\nIf you'd prefer to run phonsole on your own hardware, you'll need to set up and deploy your own client and server. Instructions for this can be found in the READMEs ([client](https://github.com/DaveWM/phonsole-client) and [server](https://github.com/DaveWM/phonsole-server)).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nDistributed under the GPL V3 license.\r\n",
